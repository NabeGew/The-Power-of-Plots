Summary
1. Capomulin and Ramicane happen to the most successful drugs in reducing tumor size. 
2. Throught the excersie the data points remained over 100. 
3. When looking at the Weight vs Overall Tumor V it displays a postive correlation that's moderate/strongly if going off the 0.84 . 
4. It would be interesting to see how the data would change if the increased the amount of mice to 1000, and offset the average between the two differnt genders
